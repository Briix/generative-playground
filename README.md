# Generative playground

Space for playing around with generative art.

Currently trying to recreate [Tim Holman's tutorials](https://generativeartistry.com/) in P5.js

## Running the project
```
// Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Briix/generative-playground

// Install dependencies
npm install

// Each individual sketch can be run with budo targeting the sketch' index.js
// for tiled_lines, this would look like
npx budo tiled_lines/index.js --live --css tiled_lines/main.css
```
